# TDD Test Results - Schema Validation Phase

## Current Status: RED Phase ✅

We have successfully completed the "Red" phase of TDD by:
1. Writing comprehensive schema validation tests BEFORE implementation
2. Creating minimal stub implementations to make tests compile
3. Tests are ready to run but will FAIL (as expected)

## Test Implementation Summary

### Tests Created
- `StgDatabaseSchemaTest.kt` with 20+ test cases covering:
  - Table creation validation
  - Column validation for all 7 tables
  - Data type validation
  - Constraint validation (NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY)
  - Default value tests
  - Foreign key relationship tests

### Stub Implementations Created
- `StgDatabase.kt` - Minimal Room database class
- `StgChapter.kt` - Minimal entity with only ID field

## Expected Test Results

When run on an emulator/device, these tests will FAIL with the following expected failures:

### Table Creation Tests ❌
- ✅ `verify_all_required_tables_exist()` - Will fail, only stg_chapters exists
- ✅ `verify_no_extra_tables_exist()` - Will fail, missing 6 tables

### Column Validation Tests ❌
- ✅ `verify_stg_chapters_table_columns()` - Will fail, missing columns (only has 'id')
- ✅ `verify_stg_conditions_table_columns()` - Will fail, table doesn't exist
- ✅ `verify_stg_content_blocks_table_columns()` - Will fail, table doesn't exist
- ✅ `verify_stg_embeddings_table_columns()` - Will fail, table doesn't exist
- ✅ `verify_stg_medications_table_columns()` - Will fail, table doesn't exist
- ✅ `verify_stg_cross_references_table_columns()` - Will fail, table doesn't exist
- ✅ `verify_stg_search_cache_table_columns()` - Will fail, table doesn't exist

### Data Type Tests ❌
- All data type tests will fail due to missing columns/tables

### Constraint Tests ❌
- All constraint tests will fail due to missing columns/tables

### Foreign Key Tests ❌
- All foreign key tests will fail due to missing relationships

## Next Steps (Green Phase)

To make these tests pass, we need to implement:

1. **All Entity Classes** with proper Room annotations:
   - StgChapter (complete implementation)
   - StgCondition
   - StgContentBlock
   - StgEmbedding
   - StgMedication
   - StgCrossReference
   - StgSearchCache

2. **Foreign Key Relationships** with CASCADE delete

3. **Default Values** for:
   - clinicalContext = "general"
   - relatedBlockIds = "[]"
   - embeddingDimensions = 768
   - weightBased = false
   - hitCount = 1

4. **Update StgDatabase** to include all entities

## Running the Tests

To run these tests on your development machine:

1. **Start an Android Emulator**:
   ```bash
   # List available AVDs
   emulator -list-avds
   
   # Start an emulator
   emulator -avd <avd_name>
   ```

2. **Run the tests**:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
   ```

3. **View detailed results**:
   ```bash
   # HTML report location
   app/build/reports/androidTests/connected/index.html
   ```

## TDD Benefits Demonstrated

1. **Clear Requirements**: Tests document exactly what the database should look like
2. **Safety Net**: When we implement, we know immediately if we break something
3. **Design First**: Forces us to think about the structure before coding
4. **Living Documentation**: Tests serve as documentation of expected behavior
5. **Confidence**: When tests pass, we know our implementation is correct

## Test Coverage Goals

- ✅ Schema structure validation
- ⏳ DAO operation tests (next phase)
- ⏳ Data integrity tests (next phase)
- ⏳ Performance tests (next phase)
- ⏳ Migration tests (future)

**Note**: This is the expected state for TDD's "Red" phase. The failing tests are not bugs - they're the specification that our implementation must satisfy.
